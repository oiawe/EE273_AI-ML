## Main components
Descriptions, reports and codes for two projects in this lesson.

## Brief Description for projects
## Project1
This is an binary classification problem that require a model to identify whether the given data implies malignant canner or not. Two sets of training data have been given along with test ones. There should be at least two kinds of trained model (KNN and logisitic regression) shown in final report. **Things become difficult** when it comes to the second dataset, where the **rate** of two kinds data provided are far from 1, approximately being *4:1*. So the core of the project is to find a way out that can properly fit this unbalanced situation.

## Project2
This is multi-classification problem based on collected ECG() signal
